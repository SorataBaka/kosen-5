abstract = {To prevent hydrophobic phase change materials (PCMs) from phase separation in water, a novel technique based on a super-hydrophobic gel, known as marshmallow-like gel, has been suggested as an effective solution. In this study, marshmallow-like gel particles, which only adsorb hydrophobic substances, were used as a carrier of a hydrophobic PCM (paraffin) to evaluate their heat transportation performance. The tetradecane-adsorbed marshmallow-like gel particles showed a latent heat of 123 kJ·kg–1, which is 56% of that of pure tetradecane (219 kJ·kg–1). Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was used as a dispersant for the superhydrophobic gel in water. An aqueous soliton of CMC (0.6 wt%) was used to prepare the slurry containing 10 wt% of tetradecane-adsorbed marshmallow-like gel particles. The heat transfer of the slurry under laminar flow was characterized, and experiments were performed in a homemade heat transfer apparatus based on a double-tube heat exchanger with an inner tube diameter of 8 mm. The heat transfer coefficient was compared with the results of the CMC solution without the particles. Due to the latent heat of tetradecane, the particles with hydrophobic PCM showed a positive effect on heat transfer characteristics. Additionally, an adequate model to describe the heat transfer under laminar flow was proposed using a modified Prandtl number to consider the effect of latent heat.}

abstract = {Foodstuff has to be transported from where it is produced or packaged to the market. It is important to control the temperature and humidity of the delivered food to minimize the waste and ensure customer satisfaction. At the same time, unfortunately, the transport sector is among the polluting sectors. Therefore, innovative solutions have been proposed such as the adoption of Latent Thermal Energy Storage (LTES) systems based on Phase Change Materials (PCMs) to control the food temperature. Such systems minimize the fuel consumption and thereby reduce the emission. LTES systems rely on the phase change process to absorb and store heat in a more sustainable way while ensuring a nearly constant temperature for the foodstuff while being transported. Hence, we first present a general overview of the application of PCMs at low temperatures. Then, the literature on the adoption of PCMs in the refrigerated transport sector is critically surveyed. Different proposals offered in the literature are recovered, compared, and critically assessed based on their merits. Despite the differences between the proposed technologies, significant advantages in terms of temperature uniformity in the refrigerated space, product thermal stress reduction, product quality, energy consumption, and pollutant emissions reduction are reported in the literature as surveyed in this paper.}

abstract = {Temperature-sensitive food products such as fruits and vegetables require refrigeration to minimise spoilage and prolong product shelf life for later consumption. To reduce food spoilage during power outages, a Phase Change Material (PCM) can be integrated into a domestic refrigerator to maintain the inside temperature constant. This study investigated three inexpensive eutectic water-salt solutions, KCl, MgCl2 and NaCl with a phase change temperature of −10 °C, −19 °C and −21 °C, because of their high latent heat and relatively low price. Transmission and air infiltration loads were used to determine the amount of PCM required to maintain the inside temperature of a KIC KBF 525/1 ME Refrigerator below 4 °C during an average 2.5-hour power outage in South Africa. From the heat loads inquired, 1.5 and 5 l were required. For both 1.5 l of KCl and NaCl the temperature of the refrigerated compartment exceeded 5 °C after 2.5 h. For the 5 l of KCl, however, the temperature of the refrigerated compartment took 20 h before exceeding 5 °C. For 5 l of NaCl, it was able to pull down the temperature and maintain 0 °C in the refrigerated compartment for close to 10 h. It took 1.5 l of KCl and NaCl 1 day and 3 days to fully solidify and 5 l of KCl and NaCl 2 days and 6 days. It was noted that to increase the heat transfer inside the refrigerator, it is advisable to use a PCM with the lowest phase change temperature, however, the PCM might not fully freeze if the freezer temperature is not drastically below the phase change temperature.}
